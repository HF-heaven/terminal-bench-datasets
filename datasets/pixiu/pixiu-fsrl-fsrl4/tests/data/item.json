  "query": "In the task of Textual Analogy Parsing (TAP), your job is to identify and label the semantic role of each token in a sentence. The labels can include 'O', 'I-QUANT', 'B-QUANT', 'I-TIME', 'B-TIME', 'I-MANNER', 'B-MANNER', 'I-THEME', 'B-THEME', 'I-VALUE', 'B-VALUE', 'I-WHOLE', 'B-WHOLE', 'I-LOCATION', 'B-LOCATION', 'I-AGENT', 'B-AGENT', 'I-CAUSE', 'B-CAUSE', 'I-SOURCE', 'B-SOURCE', 'I-REF_TIME', 'B-REF_TIME', 'I-CONDITION', 'B-CONDITION'. The 'B-' prefix indicates the beginning of a semantic role, while the 'I-' prefix denotes the continuation of that role. If a token doesn't correspond to any of these categories, assign it the 'O' label. Provide your answer as a sequence of 'token:label' pairs, with each pair on a new line.\nText: The total short interest in Nasdaq stocks as of mid-October was 237.1 million shares , up from 223.7 million in September but well below the record level of 279 million shares established in July 1987 .\nAnswer:\nText: The total short interest in Nasdaq stocks as of mid-October was 237.1 million shares , up from 223.7 million in September but well below the record level of 279 million shares established in July 1987 .",
