  "query": "In the task of Textual Analogy Parsing (TAP), your job is to identify and label the semantic role of each token in a sentence. The labels can include 'O', 'I-QUANT', 'B-QUANT', 'I-TIME', 'B-TIME', 'I-MANNER', 'B-MANNER', 'I-THEME', 'B-THEME', 'I-VALUE', 'B-VALUE', 'I-WHOLE', 'B-WHOLE', 'I-LOCATION', 'B-LOCATION', 'I-AGENT', 'B-AGENT', 'I-CAUSE', 'B-CAUSE', 'I-SOURCE', 'B-SOURCE', 'I-REF_TIME', 'B-REF_TIME', 'I-CONDITION', 'B-CONDITION'. The 'B-' prefix indicates the beginning of a semantic role, while the 'I-' prefix denotes the continuation of that role. If a token doesn't correspond to any of these categories, assign it the 'O' label. Provide your answer as a sequence of 'token:label' pairs, with each pair on a new line.\nText: These payments consisted of $ 54 million in scheduled payments and $ 121 million in prepayments , funded by $ 82.8 million from operating cash flow , zero-coupon subordinated debt and assets sales .\nAnswer:\nText: These payments consisted of $ 54 million in scheduled payments and $ 121 million in prepayments , funded by $ 82.8 million from operating cash flow , zero-coupon subordinated debt and assets sales .",
